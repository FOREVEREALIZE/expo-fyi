# The Google Classroom account switcher is a privacy nightmare
(Especially for VTubers who do "Study Streams"!)

So I made a UserCSS file to fix it!

You can find the file here: [remove-google-classroom-account-switcher.user.css](https://gist.github.com/FOREVEREALIZE/a2b3228def900d3c4536de21e92e6817/raw/b0e0629943fb0090e856b42f6c58d5e6cdc39a46/remove-google-classroom-account-switcher.user.css)

If that link doesn't open some magical menu to install it, make sure you have Stylus installed:
* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
* [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (This includes Chrome-likes such as Edge or Arc)
* [Github](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
