# The Fandom sidebar is, tbh, shit
So I made a UserCSS file to fix it!

You can find the file here: [no-fandom-sidebar.user.css](https://gist.github.com/FOREVEREALIZE/669f9162b40880c5e967e98d022672e9/raw/no-fandom-sidebar.user.css)

If that link doesn't open some magical menu to install it, make sure you have Stylus installed:
* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
* [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (This includes Chrome-likes such as Edge or Arc)
* [Github](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
